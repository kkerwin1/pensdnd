		<h1>Becoming a DM</h1>

		<p>So that this does not become a long essay, this will be turned into
			an FAQ.</p>

		<h3>What's it like being a DM?</h3>

		<p>Being a DM is like starting a new hobby. There is a time commitment.
			Skill is required, and it takes practice to develop that skill. It won't
			always be pleasant or rewarding, nor will it be so instantly. But it can
			be in the long term.</p>

		<h3>Is there a way to try out being a DM without making a long-term commitment?</h3>

		<p>Yes. Talk to Arvon or another DM about their willingness to schedule a
			"one-shot" adventure. This will require some flexibility on your part, on
			the part of the hosting DM, and on the part of the participating players.
			Be prepared to be gracious.</p>

		<h3>What is being provided for free by this site?</h3>

		<p>Hosting services only, as well as server configuration and maintenance.</p>

		<h3>What is not being provided for free?</h3>

		<p>This website will follow all copyright, intellectual property, and other
			applicable laws. Users found to be in violation of this rule shall be
			subject to banning from the site. It is the DM's obligation to obtain
			legal license and/or copies of the following:</p>

			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://foundryvtt.com/">Foundry</a>: the game server</li>
				<li>Game systems, such as:
					<li><a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/">D&D</a></li>
					<li><a href="https://paizo.com/pathfinder">Pathfinder</a></li>
					<li><a href="https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/starwarsrpg/">Star Wars FFG</a></li>
					<li>Or any <a href="https://foundryvtt.com/packages/systems">other system</a> that Foundry supports</li>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>What is the best way to buy D&D books for DMing online?</h3>

			<p>Buy digital books at <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/">dndbeyond.com</a>.</p>

			<h3>I own printed books, not digital. Or digital books in another VTT,
				such as FantasyGrounds or Roll20. Can I still DM on your site?</h3>

			<p>Yes. Talk to Arvon for this special scenario.</p>

			<h3>What is the bare minimum that I need to buy to get started DMing?</h3>

			For D&D Fifth Edition: The Player's Handbook, and the Dungeon Master's
			Guide. You will of course still need a Foundry license.

			<h3>Can I ask my players to chip in?</h3>

			There is no rule against this. However, the settled norm in the D&D
			culture is that expenses fall upon the DM and the DM alone, due to the
			"sunk costs" and reusable nature of these resources. I leave this
			up to you, but I strongly advocate that players should not be expected to
			pay to play.
